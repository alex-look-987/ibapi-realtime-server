# IB API Realtime Server – WebSocket Market Data Engine

---

## INTRODUCTION

Template for a WebSocket server designed to stream real-time market data from **Interactive Brokers (IBAPI)** for analytical or dashboard-oriented applications.

This is a **demo version** and certain files or logic were intentionally excluded due to confidentiality agreements.

The original project was developed to **Sealiah Technologies**, a private company of Algorithmic Trading.

## RESUME

A flexible and scalable WebSocket-based architecture capable of ingesting, processing, and serving market data in real time.  
Both backend and frontend layers are intentionally modular, allowing the server to adapt to various market data providers, dashboard frameworks, and real-time analytical use cases

Thanks to its **modular architecture**, every layer—data ingestion, processing, routing, and broadcasting—can be replaced or extended independently.  
This enables the solution to scale according to customer requirements, technical constraints, or the nature of the market data provider.

Suitable for different business or project requirements.
